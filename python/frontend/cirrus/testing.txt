1. Run the setup script, selecting region us-west-2, using `python -m cirrus.setup --instance-resources-only".
2. Use the AWS console to create an S3 bucket named cirrus-public-<yourname> in region us-west-2.
3. In build.ipynb, replace cirrus-public with cirrus-public-<yourname> in all cells. Run build.ipynb.
4. In publish.ipynb, replace cirrus-public with cirrus-public-<yourname> in all cells. Run publish.ipynb.
5. Re-run the setup script, selecting region us-west-2 and replacing cirrus-public with cirrus-public-<yourname> in
    the PUBLISHED_BUILD constant.
6. Run logistic_regression.ipynb, ensuring that the cell which prints the error output shows increasing accuracy.
7. Run hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb, ensuring that the cell which prints the error output shows increasing
    accuracy for I=0, I=1, and so on.
