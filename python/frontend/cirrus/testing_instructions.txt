To test the experience of a new user:
1. `pip install -e /python/frontend.cirrus`
2. `cirrus_setup`
3. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/logistic_regression.ipynb. The cell that prints the error task's output should
    show increasing accuracy.
4. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb. The cell that prints the error task's output
    should show increasing accuracy for I=0, I=1, and so on.

To test the full process for building, publishing, and running:
1. `pip install -e /python/frontend.cirrus`
1. `cirrus_setup --instance-resources-only`
2. Use the AWS console to create an S3 bucket named "cirrus-public-<yourname>". Open the bucket, and in the
    "Permissions" tab, open the "Public access settings" section. Disable "Block new public ACLs and uploading public
    objects (Recommended)" and "Remove public access granted through public ACLs (Recommended)".
3. Change setup.PUBLISHED_BUILD to "s3://cirrus-public-<yourname>".
3. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/build.ipynb.
4. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/publish.ipynb.
5. `cirrus_setup`
3. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/logistic_regression.ipynb. The cell that prints the error task's output should
    show increasing accuracy.
4. Run /python/frontend/cirrus/examples/hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb. The cell that prints the error task's output
    should show increasing accuracy for I=0, I=1, and so on.
